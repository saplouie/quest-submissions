1. Why did we add a Collection to this contract? List the two main reasons.
We need a container to hold multiple NFTs in one path since only one item can be saved at a path


2. What do you have to do if you have resources "nested" inside of another resource? ("Nested resources")

3. Brainstorm some extra things we may want to add to this contract. Think about what might be problematic with this contract and how we could fix it.

4. Idea #1: Do we really want everyone to be able to mint an NFT? ðŸ¤”.

5. Idea #2: If we want to read information about our NFTs inside our Collection, right now we have to take it out of the Collection to do so. Is this good?
