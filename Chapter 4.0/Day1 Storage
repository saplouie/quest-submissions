1. Explain what lives inside of an account. The contract code which has all the deployed contracts and the account storage where the data is stored.

2. What is the difference between the /storage/, /public/, and /private/ paths? Storage is where things actually reside. The other paths point to /storage
The main difference between the paths is access.
/storage is only accessible by the account owner in the prepare phase
/public is accessible by anyone and anywhere
private is accessed by account owner and who ever the owner gives access to.

3. What does .save() do? What does .load() do? What does .borrow() do?
.save() - saves data to a /storage/ path
.load() - takes data out of account storage
.borrow() - gets a reference to the data in account storage

4. Explain why we couldn't save something to our account storage inside of a script.
The prepare phase is where data accessed and saved.

Explain why I couldn't save something to your account.


Define a contract that returns a resource that has at least 1 field in it. Then, write 2 transactions:

A transaction that first saves the resource to account storage, then loads it out of account storage, logs a field inside the resource, and destroys it.

A transaction that first saves the resource to account storage, then borrows a reference to it, and logs a field inside the resource.
